# TravisCI-SonarCloud-PJ

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of continuous integration and code quality analysis into a Java project using Travis CI and SonarCloud. Aimed at enhancing development efficiency and code quality, this setup automates the build, analysis, and reporting processes for every commit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java (Recommended version: [insert specific version here])
- A GitHub account
- Travis CI account linked to GitHub
- SonarCloud account linked to GitHub

### Setting up the Project
1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork this repository and clone it locally to start working on the project.
2. **Travis CI Integration**: Sign in to Travis CI with your GitHub account and enable Travis CI for your forked repository.
3. **SonarCloud Integration**: Sign in to SonarCloud, add your project, and link it with your GitHub repository for automatic code quality checks.

### Configuration Files
- `.travis.yml`: Configures Travis CI builds, including the environment, scripts, and SonarCloud integration.
- `sonar-project.properties`: Configures SonarCloud analysis settings, such as project key, organization, and source directories.

## Continuous Integration and Code Quality Analysis
- **Travis CI** automatically builds the project and runs tests with every commit to GitHub.
- **SonarCloud** analyzes the code quality, including bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells, and provides a detailed report accessible from the SonarCloud dashboard.
